**SALES ANALYSIS**

**1. Data Overview**

The original dataset contains sales in 12 months in 2019, include 186850 rows and 6
columns
There are 6 attributes, including:
- Order ID: index of order
- Product: name of product
- Quantity Ordered: number of items of order
- Price Each: price of each each item of order
- Order Date: date of ordering
- Purchase Address: address of ordering
- 
**2. Data Validation**

Before jumping to the analysis process, we should do data pre-processing, including
cleaning and transformation steps. The first thing I did was merge 12 months of sales
data into a single CSV file. I also remove blank rows that had no data recorded and rows
that have column Order Data containing string objects not datetime objects. And
finally, converting the data type of some columns to the correct type.

**3. Descriptive Analysis**

3.1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

3.2 What city sold the most products?

3.3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of
customer's buying a product?

3.4 What products are most often sold together?

3.5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
